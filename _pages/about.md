&emsp;&emsp; I am a graduate student majoring in computer science and technology of Shanghai University in 2022，I graduated from Northeast Petroleum University majoring in computer science and technology. After being recommended for exemption from the examination, I successfully entered Shanghai University. The current research direction is visual rich document comprehension based on human reading order.<br>
 
**Hobbies and interests:** In my spare time, I like to learn about history through books or videos, and occasionally play games. Sports like swimming is OK, table tennis, badminton so-so.<br>

**Future plan:**   Find a job you like if you meet the requirements for a master's degree.<br>
